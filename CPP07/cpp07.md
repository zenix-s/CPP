Chapter I
Introduction
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an ex-
tension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes" (source: Wikipedia).
The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming.
This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended
to learn OOP. We decided to choose C++ since it’s derived from your old friend C.
Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will
comply with the C++98 standard.
We are aware modern C++ is way different in a lot of aspects. So if you want to
become a proficient C++ developer, it’s up to you to go further after the 42 Common
Core!

Chapter II
General rules
Compiling
• Compile your code with c++ and the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror
• Your code should still compile if you add the flag -std=c++98
Formatting and naming conventions
• The exercise directories will be named this way: ex00, ex01, ... , exn
• Name your files, classes, functions, member functions and attributes as required in
the guidelines.
• Write class names in UpperCamelCase format. Files containing class code will
always be named according to the class name. For instance:
ClassName.hpp/ClassName.h, ClassName.cpp, or ClassName.tpp. Then, if you
have a header file containing the definition of a class "BrickWall" standing for a
brick wall, its name will be BrickWall.hpp.
• Unless specified otherwise, every output message must end with a newline character
and be displayed to the standard output.
• Goodbye Norminette! No coding style is enforced in the C++ modules. You can
follow your favorite one. But keep in mind that code your peer evaluators can’t
understand is code they can’t grade. Do your best to write clean and readable code.
Allowed/Forbidden
You are not coding in C anymore. Time to C++! Therefore:
• You are allowed to use almost everything from the standard library. Thus, instead
of sticking to what you already know, it would be smart to use the C++-ish versions
of the C functions you are used to as much as possible.
• However, you can’t use any other external library. It means C++11 (and derived
forms) and Boost libraries are forbidden. The following functions are forbidden
too: *printf(), *alloc() and free(). If you use them, your grade will be 0 and
that’s it.

C++ - Module 07 C++ templates
• Note that unless explicitly stated otherwise, the using namespace <ns_name> and
friend keywords are forbidden. Otherwise, your grade will be -42.
• You are allowed to use the STL only in Modules 08 and 09. That means:
no Containers (vector/list/map, and so forth) and no Algorithms (anything that
requires including the <algorithm> header) until then. Otherwise, your grade will
be -42.
A few design requirements
• Memory leakage occurs in C++ too. When you allocate memory (by using the new
keyword), you must avoid memory leaks.
• From Module 02 to Module 09, your classes must be designed in the Orthodox
Canonical Form, except when explicitly stated otherwise.
• Any function implementation put in a header file (except for function templates)
means 0 to the exercise.
• You should be able to use each of your headers independently from others. Thus,
they must include all the dependencies they need. However, you must avoid the
problem of double inclusion by adding include guards. Otherwise, your grade will
be 0.
Read me
• You can add some additional files if you need to (i.e., to split your code). As these
assignments are not verified by a program, feel free to do so as long as you turn in
the mandatory files.
• Sometimes, the guidelines of an exercise look short but the examples can show
requirements that are not explicitly written in the instructions.
• Read each module completely before starting! Really, do it.
• By Odin, by Thor! Use your brain!!!
Regarding the Makefile for C++ projects, the same rules as in C apply
(see the Norm chapter about the Makefile).
You will have to implement a lot of classes. This can seem tedious,
unless you’re able to script your favorite text editor.

C++ - Module 07 C++ templates
You are given a certain amount of freedom to complete the exercises.
However, follow the mandatory rules and don’t be lazy. You would
miss a lot of useful information! Do not hesitate to read about
theoretical concepts.

Chapter III
Exercise 00: Start with a few
functions
Exercise : 00
Start with a few functions
Turn-in directory : ex00/
Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, whatever.{h, hpp}
Forbidden functions : None
Implement the following function templates:
• swap: Swaps the values of two given parameters. Does not return anything.
• min: Compares the two values passed as parameters and returns the smallest one.
If they are equal, it returns the second one.
• max: Compares the two values passed as parameters and returns the greatest one.
If they are equal, it returns the second one.
These functions can be called with any type of argument. The only requirement is
that the two arguments must have the same type and must support all the comparison
operators.
Templates must be defined in the header files.

C++ - Module 07 C++ templates
Running the following code:
int main( void ) {
int a = 2;
int b = 3;
::swap( a, b );
std::cout << "a = " << a << ", b = " << b << std::endl;
std::cout << "min( a, b ) = " << ::min( a, b ) << std::endl;
std::cout << "max( a, b ) = " << ::max( a, b ) << std::endl;
std::string c = "chaine1";
std::string d = "chaine2";
::swap(c, d);
std::cout << "c = " << c << ", d = " << d << std::endl;
std::cout << "min( c, d ) = " << ::min( c, d ) << std::endl;
std::cout << "max( c, d ) = " << ::max( c, d ) << std::endl;
return 0;
}
Should output:
a = 3, b = 2
min(a, b) = 2
max(a, b) = 3
c = chaine2, d = chaine1
min(c, d) = chaine1
max(c, d) = chaine2

Chapter IV
Exercise 01: Iter
Exercise : 01
Iter
Turn-in directory : ex01/
Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, iter.{h, hpp}
Forbidden functions : None
Implement a function template iter that takes 3 parameters and returns nothing.
• The first parameter is the address of an array.
• The second one is the length of the array.
• The third one is a function that will be called on every element of the array.
Turn in a main.cpp file that contains your tests. Provide enough code to generate a
test executable.
Your iter function template must work with any type of array. The third parameter
can be an instantiated function template.

Chapter V
Exercise 02: Array
Exercise : 02
Array
Turn-in directory : ex02/
Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, Array.{h, hpp}
and optional file: Array.tpp
Forbidden functions : None
Develop a class template Array that contains elements of type T and that implements
the following behavior and functions:
• Construction with no parameter: Creates an empty array.
• Construction with an unsigned int n as a parameter: Creates an array of n elements
initialized by default.
Tip: Try to compile int * a = new int(); then display *a.
• Construction by copy and assignment operator. In both cases, modifying either the
original array or its copy after copying musn’t affect the other array.
• You MUST use the operator new[] to allocate memory. Preventive allocation (al-
locating memory in advance) is forbidden. Your program must never access non-
allocated memory.
• Elements can be accessed through the subscript operator: [ ].
• When accessing an element with the [ ] operator, if its index is out of bounds, an
std::exception is thrown.
• A member function size() that returns the number of elements in the array. This
member function takes no parameters and must not modify the current instance.
As usual, ensure everything works as expected and turn in a main.cpp file that con-
tains your tests.

Chapter VI
Submission and peer-evaluation
Turn in your assignment in your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your
repository will be evaluated during the defense. Don’t hesitate to double check the
names of your folders and files to ensure they are correct.
